Merideath used to be a beautiful woman but never knew it. Through one misudnerstanding after another, she mistook others' desire for her as an insult, assuming they all hated her and thought she was hideous.

For instance, in her young adulthood, a man asked to take her out, she assumed he wanted to kill her, and was terrified, hiding under her bed for a week. 

Her fear turned into anger which then turned to vengence as she sought to rid the world of female rejection. However, she still misinterprets attraction and interest as rejection and will lash out at anyone who compliments a woman, including herself. 

She also attempted to make herself beautiful, however, because she was already beautiful, she deformed herself through pain, magic and injury to look more and more like a skeleton.
