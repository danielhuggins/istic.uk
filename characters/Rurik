Here is a description of Rurik, as if described to the player for the first time. Use this description to introduce Rurik to the player, but adapt it to the context of how the player has specifically met Rurik in the current iteration of the game:
Standing before you is a towering figure of raw, intimidating power—a true warrior of formidable strength. His sheer physical presence is enough to make anyone think twice about crossing him. This is a man who looks like he was carved from stone, his muscles bulging and rippling beneath his rough, tanned skin.

He is bald, with a scalp that gleams in the light, save for a single, bold blue stripe that runs vertically down the center of his head—a mark that might signify rank, tribe, or some gang affiliation. His face is rugged, with a nose that looks like it has been broken many times, with deep-set eyes that gleam with a mixture of cruel malice and ferocity. His lips are pulled into a broad, sinister grin, showing a row of strong, white teeth. When he smiles, his leering grin is sinister and unnerving. This is not a man to be trifled with; his expression alone conveys a sense of danger and dominance.

His upper body is bare, revealing a chest and abdomen that are a mass of chiseled muscle. The definition of his physique suggests a lifetime of combat and physical exertion. His shoulders and arms are massive, with veins bulging across his biceps and forearms. His right arm is marked with a series of thick, black bands, while his left arm bears a large, circular tattoo that could be a tribal symbol or prison tattoo. Another band of runic symbols wraps around his upper left arm, signifying that he once served in the navy.

His hands are wrapped in rough, tattered cloth, protecting his knuckles and forearms—evidence of his readiness for hand-to-hand combat. In one hand, he grips the hilt of a weapon, a heavy wooden club studded with iron. His grip is tight, showing the immense strength that lies within those hands.

He is dressed in a simple, utilitarian outfit, befitting a man of action rather than comfort. A leather strap runs across his chest, securing his rough, sleeveless tunic, which is made from thick, brown cloth, worn and frayed at the edges. His waist is encircled by a broad, studded leather belt, from which hang several pouches and small weapons— tools of his trade, be it mercenary work or more nefarious activities. The belt also holds a series of smaller knives and pouches, indicating that he is prepared for any situation.

His legs are just as muscular as his upper body, and they are clad in similar, rugged attire designed for mobility and durability rather than fashion. His boots are thick, sturdy, and well-worn, suited for long marches or battles in rough terrain.

Overall, this figure exudes the aura of a seasoned warrior, someone who has survived countless battles and emerged victorious. He carries himself with a thuggish confidence that borders on arrogance, as though he knows he is the strongest person in the room and is used to getting his way through intimidation and violence. There is no doubt that he is a dangerous individual, one who revels in the chaos and violence of battle.

Behaviour:
